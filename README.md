Another school project. This time we are creating process that creates 4 childprocesses. These childprocesses pick a random number between 0-19 and send this number to main process. Scheduler creates memory segment. Main process saves these numbers to memory segment and after that scheduler reads them from there. Scheduler sorts these numbers and prints them as a list.
